                                <h3 class="lead">ABOUT ME</h3>
                                <p class="lead"><small>I was born in Shreveport, Louisianna, but lived overseas, specifically in China, for 10 years.
                                    I attended Boston University and majored in International Relations. For the past three years,
                                    I worked as a Customer Solutions Specialist in an insurance company called Plymouth Rock Assurance.
                                    My whole life I have had to constantly adapt to new situations. As a Korean growing up in many 
                                    different countries overseas, I am what is considered a “third culture kid” and have had to learn to adapt 
                                    and succeed in any environment. I was constantly immersing myself in different cultures, providing me with many perspectives 
                                    and a global understanding from ayoung age. That experience has proven invaluable as I often apply this mindset 
                                    to the companies I work for.</small>
                                </p>
                                <p class="lead"><small>Outside of work, I am also on a dance team that gives me a space to explore my creativity through choreography, 
                                    providing me the freedom to express myself through movement. Dance has taught me the significance of always 
                                    being a student of the things I am passionate for. From watching videos and competitions on YouTube to 
                                    spending countless hours training in fundamentals and applying those fundamentals in my movement, I find 
                                    myself pursuing constant growth in this hobby, even seeking knowledge from many respected figures 
                                    in the Hip Hop community to inspire and nurture my creative output. 
                                    Though I am coming from a non-coding background, I am confident that my qualities and experience will allow me 
                                    to thrive at Coding Temple as well as the industry. Whenever there is a dream I want to attain, 
                                    I will undoubtedly do whatever it takes to make it into a reality.</small>
